                        How do I search the repository?
                    {% endblock question %}
                    {% block answer %}
                        <p>Visit our <a href="{% url 'profiles:index' %}">Repository</a> and use the search 
                            bar to narrow your search. Keywords should be separated by white spaces and can mix 
                            words from different fields (e.g. 'machine learning London' or 'neuron computational modeling').
                            You can filter results to display only profiles from under-represented countries 
                            (list based on the 
                            <a href="https://datahelpdesk.worldbank.org/knowledgebase/articles/906519-world-bank-country-and-lending-groups">World's Bank</a> 
                            list of Low, Lower-Middle and Upper-Middle income economies as of August 2017).</p>

                        <p>Look at the profile provided by the researcher and Google them for other profiles 
                            (e.g. Institution, LinkedIn, ORCID, ResearchGate, GitHub or Twitter). 
                            Read the recommendations if any, making sure they are sound 
                            (e.g. if Recommender A says 'great talk at OHBM 2017', check the OHBM 2017 program 
                            and maybe watch the video if available). Important note: the researchers are solely 
                            responsible for their profiles and we cannot guarantee authenticity.</p>

                        <p>It is a vicious circle: researchers need to be known to get invited as speakers but they 
                            need to be invited as a speaker to get known. This cycle can be broken by taking a chance 
                            and inviting someone less recognized. Bear in mind that younger scientists also have things 
                            to say and they might be more approachable and committed.</p>

                    {% block answer %}
                        <p>Visit our <a href="{% url 'profiles:index' %}">Repository</a> and enter the researcher's name 
                            in the search bar or keywords related to your field. Click on 'View Profile' to view the detailed 
                            profile of a scientist you would like to recommend. You can then click the “Recommend” button at 
                            the top right corner or click the “writing her one” link in the Recommendation section at the 
                            bottom of the profile. Anyone can submit a recommendation, disregarding their gender. 
                            Recommendations must be positive and use inclusive language. When recommending a researcher, 
                            please make sure to include all relevant information, e.g. whether you have seen this person talk 
                            at an event before, and where and when that was (as videos of the event might be available). 
                            Also include any potential conflicts of interest, disclosing any personal relationship with the 
                            scientist (e.g. colleague, close friend, student, etc.). At the moment, it is NOT possible to edit 
                            a recommendation, but <a href="mailto:admin@winrepo.org">contact us</a> for related queries.</p>

                        <p>To create a public profile in the repository, you have first to create an account by signing up. 
                            For more details on how to create an account, 
                            see <a href="#create" data-bs-toggle="collapse" data-bs-target="#create" aria-expanded="true" aria-controls="create">here</a>. 
                            When you activate your account, you will be prompted to confirm whether you identify yourself 
                            as a woman and want to create a public profile. You can also choose to continue to your account 
                            and edit your public profile later. 
                            Make sure that you also agree with our data-storing terms 
                            (see <a href="#gdpr" data-bs-toggle="collapse" data-bs-target="#gdpr" aria-expanded="true" aria-controls="gdpr">here</a>).</p>

                        <p>Please note that anyone can create an account. Yet, the only feature currently available is the 
                            creation of a public profile in the repository, if (and only if) you self-identify as a woman 
                            active in the research field of neuroscience. More features will be available in the near future 
                            through our user accounts and we will be encouraging anyone by then to sign-up. So, stay tuned!</p>
