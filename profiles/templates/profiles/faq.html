                        How do I search the repository?

                    {% block answer %}
                        <p>Visit our <a href="{% url 'profiles:index' %}">Repository</a> and use
                        the search bar to narrow your search.
                        Keywords should be separated by white spaces and can mix words from different fields
                        (e.g. 'machine learning London' or 'neuron computational modeling'). You can filter
                        results to display only profiles from under-represented countries (list based on the
                        <a href="https://datahelpdesk.worldbank.org/knowledgebase/articles/906519-world-bank-country-and-lending-groups">World's Bank</a>
                        list of Low, Lower-Middle and Upper-Middle income economies as of August 2017).</p>

                        <p>Look at the profile provided by the researcher and
                        Google them for other profiles (e.g. LinkedIn, institution, ResearchGate, â€¦).
                        Read the recommendations if any, making sure they are sound (e.g. if Recommender A says 'great talk at OHBM 2017', check the OHBM 2017 program and maybe watch the video if available). Important note: the
                        researchers are sole responsible for their profiles and we cannot guarantee authenticity.</p>

                        <p>It is a vicious circle: researchers need to be known to get
                        invited as speakers but they need to be invited as speaker to get known. This cycle
                        can be broken by taking a chance and inviting someone less recognized. Don't forget that younger scientists
                        also have things to say and they might be more approachable/committed.</p>

                        <p>Visit our <a href="{% url 'profiles:index' %}">Repository</a> and enter the researcher's name in the search bar or keywords related to your field. Click on 'View Profile' to view the detailed profile of a scientist you would like to recommend. You can then click the 'Recommend' button at the top right corner or click the 'write her one' link in the Recommendation section. Anyone can submit a recommendation, disregarding their gender. Recommendations must be positive. When recommending a researcher, please make sure to include all relevant information, e.g. whether you have seen this person talk at an event before, and where and when that was (as videos of the event might be available). Also include any potential conflicts of interest, disclosing any personal relationship with the scientist (e.g. colleague, close friend, student, ...). At the moment, it is NOT possible to edit a recommendation, but <a href="mailto:admin@winrepo.org">contact us</a> for related queries.</p>
