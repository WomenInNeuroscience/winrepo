<h2>How to:</h2>

<dl>
<dt>Find a speaker</dt>

<dd>

<p>Visit our <a href="{% url 'profiles:index' %}">Repository</a> and use the search bar to narrow your search.
  Keywords should be separated by white spaces and can mix words from different fields
  (e.g. 'machine learning London' or 'neuron computational modeling'). You can filter
  results to display only profiles from under-represented countries (list based on the
  <a href="https://datahelpdesk.worldbank.org/knowledgebase/articles/906519-world-bank-country-and-lending-groups">World's Bank</a>
  list of Low, Lower-Middle and Upper-Middle income economies as of August 2017).</p>

<p>Look at the profile provided by the researcher and
  Google them for other profiles (e.g. LinkedIn, institution, ResearchGate, â€¦).
  Read the recommendations if any, making sure they are sound (e.g. if Recommender A says 'great talk at OHBM 2017',
  check the OHBM 2017 program and maybe watch the video if available). Important note: the
  researchers are sole responsible for their profiles and we cannot guarantee authenticity.</p>

<p>It is a vicious circle: researchers need to be known to get
invited as speakers but they need to be invited as speaker to get known. This cycle
can be broken by taking a chance and inviting someone less recognized. Don't forget that younger scientists
also have things to say and they might be more approachable/committed.</p>

<p>If you cannot identify potential speakers for your event, check out these other great resources:

    <li><a href="http://www.academia-net.org/">AcademiaNet</a>, database of women in all fields of science, nominated by partner agencies.</li>
    <li><a href="https://500womenscientists.org/">500 women scientists</a>, list of women in STEM.</li>
  </ul>

<dt>Write a recommendation</dt>
<dd>Visit the <a href="{% url 'profiles:index' %}">Repository</a> and enter the researcher's name
  in the search bar. Click on 'Details' to view their profile. A button then allows to write
  a recommendation. Only 'Senior' scientists can write recommendations, which is why the 'Position'
   list only include more advanced positions. When recommending a researcher, please make sure
   to include whether you have seen this person talk at an event before, and where and when that was
   (as videos of the event might be available). Also include any potential conflicts of interest, disclosing
   any personal relationship with the scientist (e.g. colleague, close friend, student, ...). At the
 moment, it is NOT possible to edit a recommendation.
