# The Women in Neuroscience Repository (WiNRepo)
This GitHub public repository stands for the development of the website of WiNRepo - [https://www.winrepo.org](https://www.winrepo.org).

## Dependencies
All dependencies are listed in the [`requirements.txt`](requirements.txt) file, stored in the root directory of the repository. To install them, you can run in the main directory:

```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Development
To contribute, please fork the repository. In the dev branch of your own repository, rename the file `.env.default` to `.env`.
In order to have data to run the website, run the following command to generate a mock dataset: 

```
./tools/refresh_db.sh
```

The local website uses SQLite, so there is no need to install any other dependencies.

After setting up the DB, you can run the website locally using:

```
python manage.py runserver
```
